            <h2>A Little About Me! ٩(ˊᗜˋ*)و</h2>
            <p>Hello there! As you may have read on my splash page, I am currently a third year Software Engineering and
                Education student at the University of California, Irvine. I have experimented a lot with UI/UX design, digital
                art, and creative projects in the past. I value the arts because of their capabilities of showcasing emotion.
            </p>

                    <h3>Professor Shindler's Birthday Graphic</h3>
                    <p>Michael Shindler is an Associate Professor of Teaching at UCI who I happen to also 
                        be friends with and do research with. For his birthday, I collaborated with my friend
                        Rose in order to make him a special graphic. Utilizing Canva, we developed a creative graphic
                        that incorporated all of his favorite things, particularly crumple trees. The graphic features
                        each of the tree nodes as a picture of his face. I learned how to maintain good image and text
                        readability on busy backgrounds and the importance of composition.

                    </a>
                    <p>BitHacks was UCI's first embedded systems hackathon. I had the opportunity to work as a web Developer
                        and sole designer for the website. I worked closely with the Graphics and Web Development team to 
                        devise a thematic design, assets, and branding representative of the event’s mission. I utilized Figma
                        to create the low, mid, and high-fidelity designs. I leveraged Next.js and TypeScript, 
                        Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion to creatively display significant event information, graphics, 
                        and integrate mobile responsiveness for a captivating user experience.

                    <p>Soñando Sin Miedo is a student-led initiative aimed at providing low and no-income Latinx/Latine students
                        with free academic support. I work as a web developer and designer for this website. I implemented 
                        interactive testimonies slider, contact page, and responsive design using Next.js and TypeScript, 
                        CSS, and Framer Motion. I designed wireframe and high-fidelity website prototypes in Figma, 
                        crafting creative components and website layout to reflect initiative’s goals. I also lead meetings 
                        amongst developers, streamlining progression of programming and designing.

                        CareTech is a newly founded ICS club aimed at created equitable healthcare solutions through
                        innovative technology. I am currently the Marketing Head of CareTech and have had the opportunity 
                        to work on amazing projects, such as designing their website and upgrading their logo. I designed
                        the website solo using Figma. I honed my website designing skills by working on designing a website
                        with multiple pages, but I plan to work on a redesign once I am no longer taking summer classes
                        and working!

                    <p>
                        I worked as a game assets designer for the web game and app Everskies, a doll dress up game. I
                        mainly created sets, which were a collection of clothing assets that were grouped together. I utilized 
                        Procreate and ibisPaintX on a 340x221 scale canvas in order to create designs. I collaborated and contributed 
                        to on-site events alongside other designers from around the world to formulate relevant, thematic designs.
                        I developed a strong knowledge of color theory and strengthened by artistic skills as a self taught artist. Items
                        I have created and uploaded to the site can be seen in the image.
