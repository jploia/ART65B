        <h2>A Little About Me! ٩(ˊᗜˋ*)و</h2>
        <p>Hello there! As you may have read on my splash page, I am currently a third year Software Engineering and
            Education student at the University of California, Irvine. I have experimented a lot with UI/UX design, digital
            art, and creative projects in the past. I value the arts because of their capabilities of showcasing emotion.

                <h3>Professor Shindler's Birthday Graphic</h3>
                <p>Michael Shindler is an Associate Professor of Teaching at UCI who I happen to also 
                    be friends with and do research with. For his birthday, I collaborated with my friend
                    Rose in order to make him a special graphic. Utilizing Canva, we developed a creative graphic
                    that incorporated all of his favorite things, particularly crumple trees. The graphic features
                    each of the tree nodes as a picture of his face.

                    <h3>BitHacks' Web Developer & Designer</h3>
                </a>
                <p>BitHacks was UCI's first embedded systems hackathon. I had the opportunity to work as a web Developer
                    and sole designer for the website. I worked closely with the Graphics and Web Development team to 
                    devise a thematic design, assets, and branding representative of the event’s mission. I utilized Figma
                    to create the low, mid, and high-fidelity designs. I leveraged Next.js and TypeScript, 
                    Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion to creatively display significant event information, graphics, 
                    and integrate mobile responsiveness for a captivating user experience.
